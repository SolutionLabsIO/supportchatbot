## Authentication System

The application includes a simple authentication system to protect the admin dashboard and conversation logs:

1. Protected routes: `/conversations` and `/logs` require authentication
2. Login page: `/login` for admin access
3. Logout: `/logout` to end your session

Default credentials (change in `.env`):
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `your_secure_password_here`

## Facebook App Approval

To get your app approved by Facebook:

1. **Privacy Policy**:
   - The application includes a privacy policy at `/privacy`
   - Make sure this URL is publicly accessible
   - Update the contact email in `src/routes/privacy/+page.svelte`

2. **Data Deletion Callback**:
   - The application includes a data deletion API at `/api/meta/data-deletion`
   - Configure this URL in your Facebook App Dashboard under "Advanced > Data Deletion Callback URL"
   - This allows users to request deletion of their data

3. **Permissions**:

   - For a basic chatbot, you need `pages_messaging`

   - Provide clear instructions for the reviewer
   - Include test user credentials
   - Record a screencast showing your app's functionality
   - Explain how you handle user data
